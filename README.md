# How does content projection affect change detection in angular?
1. Change Detection Runs Separately:
   Angular runs change detection for each component tree separately. This means the parent component and the component receiving the projected content each have their own change detection 
   cycles.
2. Timing Matters: 
   When a parent component projects content into a child component, the parent's change detection runs before the child's. This is important because any changes in the parent that affect 
   the projected content need to be processed before the child component can react to them.

3. Potential for ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError: 
   Because the parent's change detection runs first, it's possible to encounter the dreaded ExpressionChangedAfterItHasBeenCheckedError. This happens when the parent component modifies data 
   that the child component uses in its template after the child component's change detection has already run.

4. OnPush and Content Projection: 
   When using the OnPush change detection strategy, content projection can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful. Since OnPush relies on 
   immutable data and input property changes, changes in the projected content might not always trigger change detection in the child component.

# How does the Facade pattern relate to the concept of abstraction in software design?
  The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. It relates to abstraction by hiding internal complexities and exposing 
  only what’s necessary.
  **In essence:**
    Abstraction focuses on what an object does, not how.

    Facade uses abstraction to present a clean, unified interface, shielding clients from underlying details.

  **Example:**
    Instead of interacting with multiple services (e.g., AuthService, UserService, Logger), a UserFacade can expose simple methods like login() or logout(), internally coordinating all       services.

# What are the potential drawbacks of using the Facade pattern, and how can they be mitigated?
1. **Over-Simplification**  
   May hide important features or limit flexibility for advanced users.

   ✅ *Mitigation*: Expose advanced interfaces when needed, or allow access to underlying components.

2. **Tight Coupling to Subsystems**  
   Facade becomes a central dependency; changes in subsystems may affect it.

   ✅ *Mitigation*: Use interfaces and delegation to reduce direct dependency.

3. **Single Point of Failure**  
   If the facade fails, all clients relying on it are affected.

   ✅ *Mitigation*: Ensure proper error handling and testing around the facade.

4. **Maintenance Overhead**  
   Adds another abstraction layer that must be updated with subsystem changes.

   ✅ *Mitigation*: Keep the facade focused and modular; avoid bloating it.

---

**Summary**: Use the Facade pattern wisely—balance simplicity with flexibility, and decouple it from subsystem internals.
